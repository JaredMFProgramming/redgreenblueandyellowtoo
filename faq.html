  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>1. So, this must be another one of these sites like Purple.com.</h2>
  <p>This definitely is one of these sites, alright.  You can even call it <b>"RGBY,"</b> which is short for <b>"Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, Too!"</b></p>
  <h2>2. Is there anything I can do?</h2>
  <p>You can hang around in the glory of the <a href="rgby.html">primary colors,</a> one of them used for printing, and one of them for electronic visual displays.</p>
  <h2>3. Where can I find colors other than red, green, blue, and yellow?</h2>
  <p>I don't know, but have you tried the Konami Code?  I give many thanks to the guys at <a href=https://snaptortoise.com/>SnapTortoise</a> for their
  <a href=http://snaptortoise.com/konami-js>awesome Konami Code implementation</a> that I put in this website.</p>
  <h2>4. How did you make this website?</h2>
  <p>I borrowed some source code from Damon Zuconni's website, <a href=http://www.sometimesredsometimesblue.com/>"Sometimes Red, Sometimes Blue,"</a>
  VaughnGH's <a href=http://www.notpurple.com/>NotPurple.com,</a> and
  <a href=http://purple.com>Jeff Abrahamson's internet sensation,</a> and added more stuff, like the colors yellow and green, and additional pages.
